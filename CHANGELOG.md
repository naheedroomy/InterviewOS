## [2.9.0] - 2026-09-09

### Summary

AnswerCue v2.9.0 redesigns the core interview experience from flat ephemeral meetings to first-class persistent Interview Chats with multi-round support, per-interview scoped document management, and targeted updater fixes.

### What's New

- **Persistent Interview Chats:** Interviews are now first-class persistent workspaces saved atomically to disk. Sessions created in the sidebar are preserved across app relaunches with title, rounds, context documents, and prep history intact.
- **Sidebar Redesign:** Clean sidebar listing all interview chats with double-click or context menu (`•••`) inline renaming, deletion, round counts, and live status.
- **Header Round Switcher:** Built a dedicated Round Pill Bar in the main header showing completed rounds (`✓`), active rounds (`🟢`), and a `+ Next Round` action with inline renaming.
- **"Start Next Round" Flow:** Replaced the legacy "Prepare next run" action with an intuitive transition that appends a new round, preserves company context documents, and gives candidates a fresh prep chat and timeline for their next interview round.
- **Dedicated Context Documents Panel:** Replaced the floating composer popover with a full right-hand drawer supporting drag-and-drop document upload, file kind badges (Resume, Job Description, Notes), instant detachment, and an "+ Reuse existing document" selection modal.

### Improvements

- **Updater Target Isolation:** Re-pointed updater publishing and release notes APIs from the upstream repository to `naheedroomy/AnswerCue`.
- **Spurious Update Guard:** Added a strict version comparison check to the auto-updater listener in Electron `main.ts` so that older or equal release tags never trigger spurious "newer version available" notifications.
- **Crash-Safe Persistence:** Domain state uses `.tmp` atomic file replacement on disk writes to eliminate corruption risks during unexpected shutdowns.

### Technical

- Bounded all round and workspace mutations outside React state updaters, keeping React Doctor at 0 errors.
- Added comprehensive unit test suite in `electron/services/__tests__/InterviewWorkspaceStateManager.test.mjs` verifying workspace lifecycle and atomic persistence.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-06-15

### Summary

AnswerCue v2.7.3 completes the first AnswerCue-branded release pass: new cross-platform logo assets, cleaner About text, focused model support, and inline in-app updates wired to the AnswerCue GitHub release channel.

### What's New

- **New AnswerCue logo system:** Added the flag-road mark as the app icon source and regenerated macOS `.icns`, Windows `.ico`, Linux PNG sizes, tray template, and in-app logo assets.
- **Inline update experience:** Added a Codex-style sidebar update row for available, downloading, and restart-to-install update states.
- **Interview-first About page:** Rebuilt the About screen around AnswerCue's prep, live interview, post-interview, privacy, and platform support story.
- **Focused Claude support:** Limited Anthropic selection to the latest Opus models plus Sonnet 4.6.

### Improvements

- **AnswerCue app identity:** Updated the packaged app id to `com.answercue.desktop` and moved Windows taskbar grouping away from the old upstream identity.
- **Release pipeline branding:** Updated macOS and Windows artifact names, release workflow labels, update instructions, and release templates to AnswerCue.
- **Update source isolation:** Confirmed updater metadata and release notes are pulled from `FarzamHejaziK/AnswerCue`, not the upstream repository.
- **Live interview context:** Included prep chat and selected document markdown in the live interview prompt context path.

### Fixes

- Fixed stale app names in update instructions and macOS release verification.
- Fixed the macOS release workflow check that still searched for the old app bundle name.
- Fixed Windows release packaging when Transformers.js downloads the Moonshine Base quantized graph successfully but ONNX runtime validation fails during install.
- Added the missing macOS entitlements files required by both unsigned ad-hoc packaging and future signed/notarized builds.
- Increased the macOS DMG filesystem size so Apple Silicon packages fit after embedding the local transcription model.
- Adjusted unsigned macOS release packaging so Apple Silicon ships as the updater ZIP while Intel keeps the DMG target.
- Removed the old update promotion popup path so update notices no longer look like promotional UI.
- Removed the confusing `Clear` control from the interview header.

### Technical

- Bumped the package version to `2.7.3` for release detection.
- Added `answercueSigned` metadata for signed macOS auto-install gating while preserving compatibility with older `nativelySigned` builds.
- Updated GitHub Actions Windows publishing so tagged releases can attach `AnswerCue-Setup-VERSION.exe` and `latest.yml`.
- Regenerated all platform icon outputs from the new logo source.

## [2.0.7] - 2026-03-20

### What's New
    
- **Single-Trigger Analysis**: Added a new global keybind (`Cmd+Shift+Enter`) for "Capture and Process" to instantly take a screenshot and run AI analysis.
- **Tavily Search Integration**: Replaced Google Custom Search Engine with the Tavily Search API. Features advanced depth and raw content extraction for vastly improved RAG and Company Research.
- **Enhanced Company Dossiers**: Massively expanded the Premium Profile Intelligence UI. Now includes interview difficulty badges, a 5-star work culture grid with sub-dimensions, employee reviews with sentiment analysis, critics/complaints tracking, and core benefits pills.

### Improvements
    
- **AI Language Strict Enforcement**: Rewrote the AI language enforcement pipeline. Native languages (Spanish, French, etc.) are now strongly prioritized over system prompt defaults using a triple-layer strict injection, guaranteeing the AI never incorrectly defaults back to English.
- **Model Selection Accuracy**: Rewrote `LLMHelper` routing logic to guarantee your specifically selected cloud provider model (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`) is rigorously respected during vision fallbacks, multimodal processing, and streaming.
- **Robust AI Fallbacks**: Added Gemini Flash and local Ollama models to the structured generation fallback chains, ensuring features like resume parsing work continuously even when primary models face rate limits or outages.
- **Smoother Animations**: Mac window transitions now utilize zero-opacity pre-hiding to eliminate jarring animation flashes during rapid screenshot captures.
    
### Fixes
    
- Fixed a bug where custom cURL endpoints and the "What to Say" auto-suggestion path would occasionally bypass the user's language preferences.
- Fixed the OpenAI API validation ping by upgrading the deprecated connection test model to `gpt-4o-mini`.
- Fixed UI sync issues where the AI response language dropdown could fall out of sync with the backend upon an IPC failure via a new optimistic playback system.
- Removed unused dead user interface components and completely sanitized legacy template variables from core system prompts.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-03-15

### Improvements

- **Stealth Mode UI**: The Process Disguise selector is now visually disabled and locked while Undetectable mode is active, preventing accidental state mismatches.
- **State Synchronization**: Greatly improved internal state synchronization across all application windows (Settings, Launcher, Overlay).

### Fixes

- **Infinite Feedback Loops**: Completely eliminated the bug where toggling Undetectable mode would sometimes cause the app to rapidly toggle itself on and off.
- **Delayed Dock Reappearance**: Fixed a regression where the macOS dock icon would mysteriously reappear several seconds after entering stealth mode if a disguise had recently been changed.
- **Initial State Loading**: Fixed an issue where the Settings UI would briefly show incorrect toggle states when first opened.
- **macOS OS-level Events**: Hardened the app against macOS `activate` events (like clicking the app in Finder) accidentally breaking stealth mode.

### Technical

- Refactored IPC (Inter-Process Communication) listeners for `SettingsPopup` and `SettingsOverlay` to use a strict one-way (receive-only) data binding pattern.
- Added strict management and cancellation of `forceUpdate` timeouts during stealth mode transitions.
- Added explicit type safety for the new getters in `electron.d.ts`.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-03-14

### Summary

Version 2.0.4 introduces a massive architectural overhaul to the native audio pipeline, guaranteeing production-ready stability, true zero-allocation data transfer, and instantaneous STT responsiveness with WebRTC ML-based VAD.

### What's New

- **Two-Stage Silence Processing**: Replaced basic RMS noise gating with a two-stage pipeline combining an adaptive RMS threshold and WebRTC Machine Learning VAD. Rejects typing, fan noise, and non-speech sounds before they bill STT APIs.
- **Zero-Copy ABI Transfers**: Transitioned the `ThreadsafeFunction` bridging to direct `napi::Buffer` (Uint8Array) allocations, completely eliminating V8 garbage collection pressure during continuous capture.
- **Sliding-Window RAG**: Implemented a 50-token semantic overlap in `SemanticChunker.ts` to prevent conversational context loss across chunk boundaries.

### Improvements

- **Latency & Responsiveness Tuning**: Stripped redundant TS debouncing, slashed `MIN_BUFFER_BYTES`, and reduced native hangover, achieving a ~300ms reduction in end-to-end transcription latency. short utterances ("Yes", "Stop") no longer sit trapped in the buffer.
- Removed floating-point division truncation for superior downsampling from 44.1kHz external microphones.

### Fixes

- Fixed a critical bug where the native Rust monitor returned a hardcoded `16000Hz` while actually streaming 48kHz audio. Now syncs true hardware sample rates.
- Resolved the "Input missing" silent crash bug on microphone restarts by properly recreating the CPAL stream.
- Restored the 10s continuous speech backstop for REST APIs to prevent unbounded buffer growth.
- Added missing `notifySpeechEnded()` properties and cleaned up dangerous type casts.

### Technical

- Audio processing transitioned entirely to strict ABI memory bridging (`napi::Buffer`)
- Re-architected native silence_suppression state machine around WebRTC VAD inputs.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-03-13

### What's New

- **Dynamic AI Model Selection:** Replaced static model lists with dynamic dropdowns. Your preferred models synced from providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) now automatically appear across the entire app.
- **Multimodal Resilience:** Added a "Smart Dynamic Fallback" using Groq Llama 4 Scout. If default vision models fail or get rate-limited during screen analysis, AnswerCue instantly reroutes the image to ensure uninterrupted performance.
- **Multiple Screenshot Support:** The AnswerCue Interface can now handle and process multiple attached screenshots simultaneously instead of just one.
- **Improved Settings UX:** API keys now auto-save after 5 seconds of inactivity, and selecting a preferred model immediately updates the rest of the application without requiring a page reload.

### Architecture & Fixes

- **Better Embeddings:** Migrated from Gemini Embedding to a completely new and more robust embedding architecture.
- **Claude Fixes:** Resolved max_tokens and context limits issues specific to Anthropic Claude interactions.
- **DRY Refactoring:** Centralized model configuration strings across the codebase to ensure easier future updates.
